# Higher-level programming - Python, Databases & JavaScript

This repository contains projects/codes written during my ALX-Higher Level Programing covering Python, Databases, JavaScript, etc.

Feel free to peruse through :-).

# NOTE
Just as true as it is that everyday is an opportunity to learn in the IT world, it is also worth knowing that; the codes/projects below were handled while I was still very much at the infantry stage into my career: There's every possibility that I am better of, by the time you are reading this.

Thanks.
