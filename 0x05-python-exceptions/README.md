# Python - Exceptions

My Note:
# # Syntax Error
Synatax errors are spelling mistakes and punctuation omissions in the source code of a program that may hinder the program from being executed at all.

# # Exceptions
Exceptions are errors that occur (or are detected) at program runtime.

* How do you correctly handle exceptions in Python?
